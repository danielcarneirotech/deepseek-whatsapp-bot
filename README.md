# whatsapp-deepseek-bot

This project is a WhatsApp bot that uses the `whatsapp-web.js` library to interact with the WhatsApp Web client and processes messages using a language model via an API. The bot maintains conversation history to provide context-aware responses.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A WhatsApp account
- LM Studio API running locally on `http://localhost:1234`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/danielcarneirotech/whatsapp-deepseek-bot.git
   cd whatsapp-deepseek-bot
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Ensure that the LM Studio API is running locally on `http://localhost:1234`. The language model used is specified in the code as `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b@q3_k_l`.

## Usage

1. Start the bot:

   ```sh
   node index.js
